## Summary
This tutorial will focus on introducing Q-VTK, the quantum visualization toolkit. Q-VTK aims to provide a visual interface to help developers understand the quantum hardware, quantum compiler optimization ,and result interpretation

## Authors
- Qiang Guan, Betis Behari and Priyabrata Senapati (Kent State University)

## Learning outcomes and goals
We expect the trainees to be able to understand, interpret, and utilize the quantum systems and hardware efficiently and effectively through Q-VTK, while building practical quantum applications. 
- **Understanding Quantum Behavior and Errors**. The developers needs to have  the ability to understand and articulate how quantum algorithms operate and why they produce specific outcomes. This includes grasping the nuances of quantum behavior such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, as well as understanding the nature and impact of quantum errors.For quantum applications to be reliable and useful, developers must accurately predict and mitigate the effects of quantum errors and noise.
